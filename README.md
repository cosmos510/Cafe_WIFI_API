Want to work in a cafe but need power and Wi-Fi?  You've found the right place!\
Find venues with reliable Wi-Fi, ample power sockets, and comfy seating areas.\
Discover the best times to work, based on community data.

Cafe wifi API contain two Flask App:

- One is an API that serves data on cafes with wifi and good coffee. [Here is the documentation for the API](https://web.postman.co/workspace/fc5a9b19-e5f1-4c96-896d-012be7589934/documentation/31455280-c7a11140-b47a-4d82-b5c7-42355637b5b0)
- The other use the data from the API to build a fully-fledged website to display the information.

This project is still in development. I'm planning to add user and user would be able to leave review about their stay in the coffee.
